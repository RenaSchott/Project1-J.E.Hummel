# Johann Erdmann Hummel

This website is about an ancestor of mine. Johann Erdmann Hummel was a painter in the hist. Biedermeier time in Berlin. As a professor, he had influence
on future generations in art and architecture with his talents in drawing different perspectives.

of his on the landing page. More informations are on the respective sites (Biography, Paintings and Exhibitions). Very one is encouraged to participate
