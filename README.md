# Johann Erdmann Hummel

This website is about an ancestor of mine. Johann Erdmann Hummel was a painter in the hist. Biedermeier time in Berlin. As a professor he had influence
on future generations in art and architecture with his talents in drawing different perspectives. 

Users of this website will find different informations about J.E. Hummel as a short summary together with an appealing painting
og his on the landing page. More informations are on the respective sites (Biography, Paintings and Exhibitions). Very one is encouraged to participate
in spreading the word of new or old exhibitions and publications by using the respective contact form.
In general, this site was written for users interested in Biedermeier Art.
